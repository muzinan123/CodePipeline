# AWS CodePipeline with Lambda Project

## Overview

This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, aimed at automating the build, test, and deployment processes for applications, including AWS Lambda functions.

## Background

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. This project leverages AWS CodePipeline to automate the entire release process, from code commit to production deployment, including the deployment of AWS Lambda functions.

## Features

- **Automated Builds**: Automatically triggers builds on every code commit.
- **Automated Testing**: Runs tests automatically after the build to ensure code quality.
- **Automated Deployments**: Deploys applications and Lambda functions to target environments using various deployment strategies.
- **Pipeline Visualization**: Provides a visual interface to monitor the status and logs of each pipeline stage.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project includes the following components:

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository for storing and managing code.
- **Build Service**: AWS CodeBuild for building and testing code.
- **Deployment Service**: AWS Lambda for serverless function deployment.
- **Pipeline Service**: AWS CodePipeline for defining and managing the CI/CD pipeline.
